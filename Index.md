**My R Resources**  
The R Resource section has collection of tasks that are done in R. This is meant for quick reference and is especially useful when I switch back and forth between Programming Languages. RBasic1 has the sytaxes for common R tasks and these are  generated in RStudio using knitr in the results = 'hide' mode.
